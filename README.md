# TwilioAutomatedCalling

A simple flask-based website which allows you to make outgoing calls using Twilio's API and play a pre-recorded audio message at the push of a button if you reach someone's answering machine. 

Useful for calling large volumes of people and where many may not be immediately available so that you can leave messages easily instead of having to repeat yourself.

Install Twilio's python library first and note that you will need an Account SID and Auth Token from Twilio (there's a free trial) to use this.
